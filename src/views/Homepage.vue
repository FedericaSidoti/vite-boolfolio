                <h2>Hi there! ðŸ––</h2> 
                        <p>I am <span>Federica Sidoti</span>, a junior full stack web developer and tech enthusiast. </p>
                        <p>I started coding for fun, fixing and making adjustments to <span>RPG websites</span> (WoD never dies, PlayByChat never dies!). </p>
                        <p>Then I rediscovered my passion: one IT course at university and I was in love again!</p>
                        <p>I love learning new coding skills, languages & frameworks: <span>curiosity</span> does NOT kill cats, really (or so I hope). </p>
                        <p>I especially love coding in a team. Since the beginning I learned with great help from teachers, more experienced developers, even forums and friendly neighbourhood enthusiasts on the Web. I feel that <span>working together</span> and <span>never gatekeeping knowledge</span> is one of the best parts in the DEV world. </p>
                        <p>Yes, I'm <span>nerd and a proud one</span>. LARPs and RPGs are my favourite pastimes! (but chess is also worth a mention). </p>
